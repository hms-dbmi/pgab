# Prompt for Creating a Table of Pediatric Growth Disorders

Create a comprehensive table summarizing key pediatric growth disorders, focusing on their impact on weight and height growth patterns, major symptoms, typical diagnosis age, growth trajectory after intervention, and other relevant features. Use DeepSearch mode to iteratively search the web and analyze credible medical sources (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, reputable medical websites like CDC, NIH, or Mayo Clinic) to ensure accuracy and up-to-date information. The table must include the following pediatric growth disorders: Growth Hormone Deficiency, Turner Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Achondroplasia, Congenital Hypothyroidism, Precocious Puberty, Crohnâ€™s Disease, Hypothyroidism (acquired), Delayed Puberty, and Celiac Disease. Include additional relevant disorders if appropriate. For each disorder, include the following columns:

1. **Disorder Name**: The name of the growth disorder.
2. **ICD-10 Code**: Provide the specific ICD-10 code(s) for the disorder (e.g., E23.0 for Growth Hormone Deficiency).
3. **Prevalence/Incidence**: Provide the estimated prevalence or incidence rate (e.g., 1 in X births or population).
4. **Weight Growth Pattern**: Describe how the disorder affects weight (e.g., normal, increased, decreased).
5. **Height Growth Pattern**: Describe how the disorder affects height (e.g., short stature, normal, excessive growth).
6. **Major Symptoms**: List key symptoms associated with the disorder (e.g., delayed puberty, facial features, developmental delays).
7. **Typical Diagnosis Age**: Indicate the age range when the disorder is typically diagnosed (e.g., infancy, childhood, adolescence).
8. **Diagnostic Methods**: Briefly describe common diagnostic approaches (e.g., genetic testing, hormone levels, imaging).
9. **Treatment Options**: Summarize primary treatments (e.g., hormone therapy, nutritional support, surgical interventions).
10. **Growth Trajectory After Intervention**: Describe the expected growth pattern (weight and height) following standard treatment (e.g., improved height velocity, normalized weight gain, limited impact).
11. **Associated Complications**: List key long-term complications (e.g., cardiovascular issues, obesity-related conditions).

Ensure the table is clear, concise, and well-organized, with data validated from reliable sources. If conflicting information is found, prioritize sources from established medical institutions and note any uncertainties. Format the output as a markdown table for readability.
