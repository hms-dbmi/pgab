| **Achondroplasia** | Q77.4 | 1 in 15,000-40,000 births | Normal weight gain | Disproportionate short stature (final height ~130 cm males, 125 cm females) | Disproportionate dwarfism, large head, frontal bossing, trident hands, lordosis | Birth (often prenatal) | Clinical features, skeletal X-rays, genetic testing (FGFR3 mutations) | Limb lengthening surgery (controversial), spine surgery if needed, supportive care | Limited improvement with current treatments, experimental therapies under investigation | Spinal stenosis, sleep apnea, hydrocephalus, joint problems |
| **Congenital Hypothyroidism** | E03.1 (Congenital hypothyroidism without goiter), E03.0 (with goiter) | 1 in 2,000-4,000 newborns | Poor weight gain initially, later excessive weight gain if untreated | Severely impaired linear growth | Prolonged jaundice, constipation, lethargy, large fontanelles, developmental delays | Birth (newborn screening) | Newborn TSH/T4 screening, thyroid scintigraphy, ultrasound | Levothyroxine replacement therapy | Normal growth if treated within first weeks of life | Intellectual disability if untreated, cardiac complications |
| **Precocious Puberty** | E30.1 (Precocious puberty) | 1 in 5,000-10,000 children (more common in girls) | Accelerated weight gain, early development | Initially accelerated, then premature growth cessation | Early secondary sexual characteristics, advanced bone age, behavioral changes | <8 years (girls), <9 years (boys) | Physical exam, bone age, hormonal studies (LH, FSH, estradiol/testosterone), brain MRI | GnRH agonists (if central), treat underlying cause | Slower growth velocity during treatment, preservation of final adult height | Psychosocial issues, reduced final adult height if untreated |
| **Crohn's Disease** | K50.9 (Crohn's disease, unspecified) | 1-5 per 100,000 children | Poor weight gain, weight loss, malnutrition | Linear growth failure (60-80% of cases) | Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, delayed puberty | 10-20 years (peak adolescence) | Colonoscopy, imaging (CT/MRI), inflammatory markers, stool studies | Anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, biologics, nutritional support | Catch-up growth possible with disease control and nutritional rehabilitation | Bowel complications, extraintestinal manifestations, growth failure |
| **Acquired Hypothyroidism** | E03.9 (Hypothyroidism, unspecified) | 1-2% of children and adolescents | Weight gain, decreased metabolic rate | Decreased growth velocity | Fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, poor school performance | School age to adolescence | TSH, free T4, thyroid antibodies (TPO, Tg) | Levothyroxine replacement therapy | Normalization of growth velocity within 6-12 months of treatment | Learning difficulties if prolonged, cardiovascular effects |
| **Constitutional Delayed Puberty** | E30.0 (Delayed puberty) | 2-3% of adolescents | Normal weight pattern, delayed pubertal weight gain | Normal growth velocity until expected pubertal growth spurt is delayed | Absent or delayed secondary sexual characteristics, short stature during adolescence | 13-14 years (girls), 14-15 years (boys) | Physical exam, bone age, hormonal studies, family history | Observation, low-dose hormone therapy if psychological distress | Normal final adult height achieved, delayed but normal pubertal growth spurt | Psychosocial impact, potential bone density issues |
| **Celiac Disease** | K90.0 (Celiac disease) | 1 in 100-300 children | Poor weight gain, failure to thrive | Linear growth failure in 40-60% of cases | Chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, irritability, dental enamel defects | 6 months - 2 years (peak), but can occur at any age | Serology (anti-tTG, anti-endomysial), small bowel biopsy, genetic testing (HLA-DQ2/DQ8) | Strict gluten-free diet | Catch-up growth within 6-24 months of gluten-free diet | Osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, lymphoma (if untreated) |

## Data Sources and Validation

This table has been compiled from multiple credible medical sources including:

- Novo Nordisk's medical reference for ICD-10 codes (collected June 2024)
- Medscape's clinical references indicating congenital hypothyroidism affects 1 of every 4,000 newborns
- Orphanet database for rare disease definitions and characteristics
- BMC Pediatrics study on growth complications in inflammatory bowel disease

## Key Notes

1. **ICD-10 Codes**: Codes may vary based on specific subtypes and associated conditions. Multiple codes may be applicable for a single patient.

2. **Prevalence Data**: Some disorders show geographic and ethnic variations in prevalence rates.

3. **Treatment Response**: Growth trajectory after intervention depends heavily on:
   - Age at diagnosis and treatment initiation
   - Severity of the underlying condition
   - Compliance with treatment
   - Presence of associated complications

4. **Early Intervention**: Most growth disorders benefit significantly from early diagnosis and intervention, particularly during periods of rapid growth.

5. **Multidisciplinary Care**: Many of these conditions require coordinated care involving pediatric endocrinologists, geneticists, gastroenterologists, and other specialists.
