# Prompt for Combining Pediatric Growth Disorders Tables into a Comprehensive Markdown File

You have been provided with multiple markdown files containing tables of pediatric growth disorders, each generated by different LLMs based on a prior prompt. Your task is to create a single, comprehensive markdown file with a table that combines all the data from these input tables, ensuring maximum completeness, accuracy, and consistency. The table must include all unique disorders from the inputs, with a minimum of the following required disorders: Growth Hormone Deficiency, Turner Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Achondroplasia, Congenital Hypothyroidism, Precocious Puberty, Crohn’s Disease, Hypothyroidism (acquired), Delayed Puberty, and Celiac Disease. Include additional disorders from the input tables if they are relevant and supported by credible sources. Use DeepSearch mode to iteratively search the web and validate data using credible medical sources (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, CDC, NIH, Mayo Clinic) to resolve conflicts or fill in missing information.

The final table must include the following columns for each disorder:

1. **Disorder Name**: The name of the growth disorder.
2. **ICD-10 Code**: The specific ICD-10 code(s) for the disorder (e.g., E23.0 for Growth Hormone Deficiency).
3. **Prevalence/Incidence**: The estimated prevalence or incidence rate (e.g., 1 in X births or population).
4. **Weight Growth Pattern**: How the disorder affects weight (e.g., normal, increased, decreased).
5. **Height Growth Pattern**: How the disorder affects height (e.g., short stature, normal, excessive growth).
6. **Major Symptoms**: Key symptoms associated with the disorder (e.g., delayed puberty, facial features, developmental delays).
7. **Typical Diagnosis Age**: The age range when the disorder is typically diagnosed (e.g., infancy, childhood, adolescence).
8. **Diagnostic Methods**: Common diagnostic approaches (e.g., genetic testing, hormone levels, imaging).
9. **Treatment Options**: Primary treatments (e.g., hormone therapy, nutritional support, surgical interventions).
10. **Growth Trajectory After Intervention**: Expected growth pattern (weight and height) following standard treatment (e.g., improved height velocity, normalized weight gain, limited impact).
11. **Associated Complications**: Key long-term complications (e.g., cardiovascular issues, obesity-related conditions).

### Instructions for Combining the Tables
1. **Compile All Disorders**: Extract all disorders from the input markdown tables, ensuring the required disorders (listed above) are included. Add any additional disorders from the inputs if they are relevant and verified by credible sources.
2. **Merge Data**: For each disorder, combine data across all input tables for each column. If multiple tables provide data for the same disorder, synthesize the information to create a single, comprehensive entry.
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: If there are discrepancies (e.g., different prevalence rates or diagnostic methods), use DeepSearch mode to cross-check with credible medical sources (e.g., CDC, NIH, peer-reviewed journals). Prioritize the most recent and authoritative data, and note any significant uncertainties in a footnote or separate section below the table.
4. **Fill Gaps**: If any column for a disorder is missing data in all input tables, use DeepSearch to retrieve accurate information from reliable sources.
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Standardize terminology (e.g., use “short stature” consistently instead of “stunted growth”) and formatting (e.g., prevalence as “1 in X” or percentage) across the table.
6. **Remove Redundancies**: If multiple tables list the same disorder with identical data, include only one entry. If disorders are listed under slightly different names (e.g., “Hypothyroidism” vs. “Acquired Hypothyroidism”), clarify and use the most specific term, ensuring Congenital Hypothyroidism and Hypothyroidism (acquired) are distinct.
7. **Format Output**: Present the final table in markdown format with clear column headers and aligned rows. Use bullet points or concise phrases within cells to maintain readability. Include a brief introduction above the table summarizing its purpose and scope.

### Output Requirements
- The output must be a single markdown file with a well-organized table.
- Ensure all required disorders are included, even if some input tables omit them, by sourcing missing data via DeepSearch.
- If an input table includes a disorder not in the required list, verify its relevance before including it.
- Place any notes on conflicts or uncertainties in a separate section below the table, not within the table itself.
- The table should be sorted alphabetically by Disorder Name for ease of reference.

# Comprehensive Pediatric Growth Disorders Table

This table combines data from multiple LLM-generated tables to provide a comprehensive overview of pediatric growth disorders, validated with credible medical sources.

| Disorder Name | ICD-10 Code | Prevalence/Incidence | Weight Growth Pattern | Height Growth Pattern | Major Symptoms | Typical Diagnosis Age | Diagnostic Methods | Treatment Options | Growth Trajectory After Intervention | Associated Complications |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Disorder 1]  | [Code]      | [Rate]               | [Pattern]             | [Pattern]             | [Symptoms]     | [Age Range]           | [Methods]          | [Treatments]      | [Trajectory]                         | [Complications]          |
| [Disorder 2]  | [Code]      | [Rate]               | [Pattern]             | [Pattern]             | [Symptoms]     | [Age Range]           | [Methods]          | [Treatments]      | [Trajectory]                         | [Complications]          |
