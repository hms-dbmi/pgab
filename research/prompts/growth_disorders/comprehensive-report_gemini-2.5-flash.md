## Notes
- **Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Weight Growth Pattern**: The consensus from multiple sources indicates that children with GHD often present with increased adiposity or a chubby appearance relative to their height, rather than weight loss or normal weight.
- **Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Typical Diagnosis Age**: The typical diagnosis age for GHD varies depending on the presentation. While growth faltering can become apparent as early as 2-3 years, diagnosis often occurs between 2-8 years of age, or later in adolescence (10-16 years) if delayed puberty is the primary concern.
- **Congenital Hypothyroidism Weight Growth Pattern**: Untreated congenital hypothyroidism leads to poor feeding and lethargy, which can result in poor weight gain or failure to thrive due to slowed metabolism. With appropriate and early treatment, weight gain and overall growth typically normalize.
- **Noonan Syndrome and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** were included as they were present in some of the input tables or explicitly mentioned as relevant for pediatric growth disturbances, and comprehensive information was sourced via web search to fulfill all required columns.
