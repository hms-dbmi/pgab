## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive investigation into Large Language Model (LLM) benchmark datasets pertinent to pediatric growth assessment in healthcare. It delineates the critical objectives of pediatric growth monitoring, identifies and characterizes existing datasets, evaluates their suitability for LLM applications, and highlights significant gaps and challenges. The report further explores potential LLM applications in this domain and offers actionable recommendations for developing robust, ethically sound, and clinically validated LLM benchmarks. The current landscape reveals a critical need for more diverse, longitudinal, and multimodal pediatric-specific data resources to mitigate age-related biases and unlock the full potential of LLMs in improving child health outcomes.

## **1\. Objectives of Pediatric Growth Assessment in Healthcare**

Pediatric growth assessment is a cornerstone of child healthcare, serving as a vital indicator of overall health, nutrition, and developmental progression from birth through adolescence. Its primary objective is to monitor a child's physical and developmental trajectory against established norms to facilitate early detection and intervention for potential health issues.

### **1.1 Core Metrics and Developmental Milestones**

Pediatric growth assessment fundamentally relies on a suite of anthropometric measurements. These include **height/length, weight, body mass index (BMI), and head circumference**.1 These physical indicators are crucial for evaluating a child's physical growth and progress toward maturity, providing clues to health conditions that impede physical growth.1 Accurate values are essential for correct interpretation of these measurements.2  
Beyond physical growth, comprehensive assessment includes **developmental milestones**, which are age-specific abilities most children can achieve by a certain age.4 These milestones span several critical domains:

* **Cognition:** Encompasses thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding.4 This also includes foundational academic skills such as counting and learning letters and numbers.4  
* **Motor Coordination:** Involves both gross motor skills, such as rolling over, crawling, walking, jumping, and hopping, and fine motor skills, including drawing, stacking, and grasping small objects.4  
* **Language Skills:** Tracks the progression from early vocalizations like cooing and imitating sounds to purposeful crying, the use of gestures, single words, and eventually two-to-three-word sentences.4  
* **Social Interaction:** Assesses how children interact with others, demonstrate emotion, initiate peer contact, and engage in group play, with examples including smiling at people and playing games like peek-a-boo.4  
* **Adaptive Skills:** Relate to self-care and daily living activities, such as dressing, eating with a spoon, and washing.4

These assessments span from **newborns to adolescents**, with specific milestones and measurement interpretations varying across different age ranges.1 For instance, head circumference measurements are particularly important for infants and young children, typically from birth to age 2 years, as they reflect brain growth and development.1

### **1.2 Clinical Significance and Decision-Making**

Monitoring growth is central to the practice of pediatrics, serving as a vital tool for improving public health and facilitating health screening of young children.6 It provides critical insights into a child's physical, emotional, and social development, and functions as a strong indicator of population health.6  
Accurate and timely assessment is crucial for the early diagnosis and effective monitoring of various health conditions. Deviations from normal growth patterns may signify an abnormality, making it essential for healthcare providers to monitor these trends over time.1 This includes:

* **Growth Faltering/Malnutrition:** Faltering growth is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, longer hospital stays, and reduced school performance and cognitive development in the long term.2 A sustained drop through two or more weight centiles is unusual and warrants investigation.3  
* **Obesity:** Upward centile-crossing for weight in infancy, or "growth acceleration," increases the risk of later obesity and cardiovascular disease.3 A Body Mass Index (BMI) above the 91st centile suggests a child is overweight, and above the 98th centile indicates clinical obesity.3  
* **Endocrine Disorders:** Growth patterns can provide important clues to underlying health conditions, including pediatric endocrine or metabolic disorders.7  
* **Developmental Delays:** Not reaching milestones or reaching them significantly later than peers can be the earliest indication of a developmental delay.4 Children who do not meet expected milestones may require extra support and services to reach their full potential.4 Formal developmental tests, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID), are widely accepted diagnostic tools for identifying such delays.9

Growth charts, developed by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are standardized tools used to compare an individual child's growth to a normal reference population, thereby helping to define normal and abnormal growth patterns and track progress over time.2 These charts contribute to forming an overall clinical impression for each child, guiding investigations, nutritional assessment, and interventions.2 However, they are not intended to be used as a sole diagnostic instrument.2 Comparing a child's height centile to their mid-parental centile can help assess if growth is proceeding as expected, with large discrepancies potentially indicating a growth disorder.3 Regular measurements combined with a general health assessment are sensitive indicators for early intervention.3  
The long-term implications of early growth patterns are profound. For instance, growth trajectories from conception to 2 years of age have been shown to predict intelligence quotients in adults and strongly influence a population's productivity and human capital.6 Additionally, bone age studies, typically performed using a single X-ray of the left wrist, hand, and fingers, can help estimate the maturity of a child's skeletal system.8 This assessment can predict how much longer a child will be growing, when they will likely start puberty, and their potential final adult height.8 Such information is invaluable for guiding treatment decisions in cases of genetic growth disorders or for timing interventions for orthopedic or orthodontic problems.8  
The interconnectedness of physical growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes is a critical aspect of pediatric assessment. Physical, psychosocial, and cognitive aspects of child development are interrelated key indicators of a child's overall health.1 Growth assessment is not merely about physical measurements but also about understanding a child's physical, emotional, and social development.6 Developmental milestones, which track how children play, learn, speak, act, and move, provide crucial clues about a child's developmental health.4 This broad perspective suggests that LLMs for pediatric growth assessment must ideally integrate both quantitative anthropometric data and qualitative developmental observations to provide a truly comprehensive picture of a child's well-being. An LLM focusing solely on physical growth metrics would miss crucial aspects of a child's health and potential long-term outcomes, thereby limiting its clinical utility.  
The dynamic nature of pediatric data underscores the fundamental requirement for longitudinal information. Normal growth and development occur in a predictable sequence but at a variable rate and pace.1 Deviations from this pattern may signify an abnormality, making it essential for healthcare providers to monitor these trends over time.1 For example, a child's weight may not always follow a specific centile line but should generally track within one centile space; a sustained drop through two or more weight centiles is unusual and warrants investigation.3 This demonstrates that single-point measurements are insufficient; the pattern and trajectory of growth are paramount for accurate clinical interpretation. Therefore, any dataset or LLM designed for pediatric growth assessment must inherently incorporate longitudinal data to capture these critical trends and enable accurate clinical interpretation, moving beyond static snapshots.  
The predictive power of early growth patterns for adult health and societal impact is a compelling aspect of pediatric assessment. The observation that growth trajectories from conception to 2 years of age can predict intelligence quotients in adults and significantly influence a population's productivity and human capital highlights the profound, long-term implications of early childhood health.6 This connection elevates the importance of accurate pediatric growth assessment beyond individual clinical care to a public health imperative. LLMs that can accurately predict these long-term outcomes, even probabilistically, could inform early interventions with significant societal benefits, making the development of such tools highly impactful for both individual well-being and national productivity.

## **2\. Identification and Characterization of Relevant Datasets**

Identifying benchmark datasets specifically tailored for LLM-based pediatric growth assessment presents a challenge, as many existing resources are either general medical datasets with limited pediatric focus or pediatric datasets not explicitly designed for LLM benchmarking. This section identifies and characterizes datasets that are directly relevant or hold significant potential for this purpose.

### **2.1 Benchmark Datasets for LLMs in Healthcare**

The "LLM Health Benchmarks Dataset" on Hugging Face is a specialized resource for evaluating LLMs across various medical specialties, including a "Pediatrics" split.11 It contains approximately 7,500 structured question-answer pairs, with 180 specifically in the Pediatrics split.11 This dataset is designed to assess the accuracy and contextual understanding of AI in healthcare, employing metrics such as Exact Match, F1 Score, and Semantic Similarity.11  
A significant challenge in the field is the pervasive "age bias" in existing medical Question-Answering (QA) benchmarks, where pediatric medicine remains notably underrepresented in both research and dataset development.13 This imbalance stems from fundamental physiological and developmental differences between children and adults, as well as a historical bias favoring adult-centric medical literature.13 Consequently, LLMs trained predominantly on existing adult medical corpora may exhibit age-related biases, leading to suboptimal performance in pediatric contexts.13  
To address these critical gaps, new evaluation benchmarks specifically curated to enhance pediatric medical representation are being introduced.13 The work titled "What About the Children? Evaluating and Mitigating Ageism in Medical QA Benchmarks" exemplifies such an initiative, highlighting the critical need for age-inclusive AI to ensure equitable healthcare outcomes.13

### **2.2 General Pediatric Healthcare Datasets**

**WHO and CDC Growth Charts:** These are fundamental reference standards for pediatric growth assessment.

* **CDC Child Growth Charts:** These charts consist of a series of percentile curves that illustrate the distribution of selected body measurements in U.S. children.10 They have been widely used by pediatricians, nurses, and parents in the United States since 1977 to track the growth of infants, children, and adolescents.10 The associated data files provide LMS parameters and smoothed percentiles for various growth measurements, including age, BMI, head circumference, length, and weight.10 These charts primarily cover ages 1 to 21 years, utilizing data collected between 1965 and 2000\.10 The data is publicly accessible through data.gov.10  
* **WHO Growth Charts:** These charts describe the growth of children aged 0 to 59 months (0-5 years) living in environments believed to support optimal growth, based on selected, healthy, and well-nourished populations from six countries globally.6 The data files provide LMS parameters and selected smoothed percentiles for weight-for-age, length-for-age, weight-for-length, and head circumference-for-age, categorized by sex and single month of age.15 These resources are publicly available for download from CDC and WHO websites.15

**Electronic Health Record (EHR) Datasets:**

* **PEDSnet:** A large, national community of pediatric healthcare institutions, PEDSnet has created a 10-year, analysis-ready database for more than 6.2 million children.16 It utilizes an evolving Common Data Model (CDM) based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, which has been expanded to accommodate specific pediatric requirements and ensure interoperability with the PCORnet Data Model.16 The database includes comprehensive longitudinal data, encompassing demographics, diagnoses (mapped to standardized SNOMED-CT codes), medications (mapped to RxNorm codes), **measurement data (including lab tests, anthropometrics like height, weight, and head circumference, and vital signs)**, procedures, provider information, and visit details.20 This data is de-identified and accessible for research through collaboration requests.21  
* **All of Us Research Program:** This program contains a rich resource of retrospective pediatric EHR data for nearly 20,000 participants, including physical measurements (PMs) taken at enrollment and comprehensive EHR data dating back to 1980\.23 It represents one of the largest and most diverse patient cohorts in the U.S., making it particularly useful for studying long-term trends such as pediatric obesity.23 The data is publicly accessible through the All of Us Researcher Workbench.23  
* **Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) Longitudinal Pediatric Data Resource (LPDR):** This resource is designed to capture, store, analyze, visualize, and share genomic and phenotypic data over the lifespan of newborns diagnosed with a condition through newborn screening.24 It contains 24,172 core and disease-specific Common Data Elements (CDEs) for 118 rare genetic diseases, standardized with LOINC, SNOMED CT, and ICD-9/10 codes.24 De-identified datasets are available for secondary research and data mining.24  
* **MIMIC-III / eICU-CRD (Limited Pediatric Scope):** While MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) are extensive critical care databases 25, MIMIC-III is generally restricted to patients aged 18 and above for many analyses.25 However, one study extracted data for 1258 neonates from the MIMIC-III database for mortality prediction, indicating that some pediatric data exists within it.28 The eICU-CRD also contains billions of high-quality clinical data points from U.S. hospitals 27, but its explicit pediatric growth focus is not a primary characteristic.

**Imaging Datasets:**

* **RSNA AI Pediatric Bone Age Challenge 2017 Dataset:** A prominent dataset specifically for bone age assessment, it comprises 126,111 pediatric left-hand X-ray images, each labeled with the subject's sex and bone age.7 The subjects' ages span from 1 month to 228 months (19 years).7 This dataset was developed by Stanford University and the University of Colorado and meticulously annotated by multiple expert observers.7 It is publicly accessible for academic research and education, with specific attribution requirements.29  
* **ARAN (Age-Restricted Anonymized) Dataset:** This dataset contains 2048 anonymized full-body images of 512 children (aged 16 to 98 months), captured from four different viewpoints.22 It is accompanied by precise anthropometric measurements for each child, including height, weight, head circumference, and waist circumference.22 The dataset is labeled and explicitly approved by an ethics committee under European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines, addressing critical privacy concerns.30  
* **TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive):** TCIA hosts high-quality imaging datasets from pediatric cancers, including radiologist-reviewed 3D tumor segmentations and associated volume calculations.22 While its primary focus is not growth assessment, it demonstrates the availability of significant pediatric imaging data that could potentially be integrated for multimodal growth analysis.

**Developmental Milestones Datasets:**

* **childdevdata R package:** This package bundles anonymous microdata from ten studies, totaling 1,116,061 assessments made on 10,831 unique children.32 It covers ages 0-5 years and utilizes 21 different developmental assessment instruments.32 The dataset includes raw milestone scores and supports multiple measurement instruments, with data originating from diverse countries such as Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Jamaica, Madagascar, Netherlands, and South Africa.32 It is publicly accessible via CRAN and GitHub under a CC BY 4.0 license.32  
* **KidSpeak:** This project introduces a multi-task speech-input foundation model specifically designed for children's speech recognition and screening.34 It is trained on children's speech data and utilizes the CHILDES dataset, demonstrating the potential for LLMs to process auditory data for developmental assessment.34

**Genetic/Phenotype Datasets:**

* **Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC):** An NIH initiative, the Kids First DRC serves as a centralized repository for harmonized genomic sequencing data from children diagnosed with pediatric cancer and congenital disorders.35 It contains over 188,000 data records, including germline and somatic variants, phenotypes mapped to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and diagnoses mapped to the MONDO Disease Ontology.35 Access requires registration and dbGaP authorization for controlled studies.36  
* **Facial phenotype-Gene-Disease Dataset (FGDD):** This is an explainable dataset that links distinctive facial phenotypes to rare genetic diseases, compiled from 509 research publications.29 It contains 1,147 data records with demographic, variation, and phenotype information, and 689 records with associated disease labels.38 The dataset is available in CSV and knowledge graph formats under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.38

The current landscape of available data reveals a notable paradox: while there is an abundance of general medical data, there is a distinct scarcity of pediatric-specific data, particularly for LLM benchmarking. Medical Question-Answering (QA) benchmarks frequently demonstrate an "age bias," with pediatric medicine being significantly underrepresented in both research and dataset development.13 This means that LLMs trained predominantly on adult-centric medical corpora may perform suboptimally or even exhibit biases when applied to pediatric contexts. For example, the "LLM Health Benchmarks Dataset" includes only 180 pediatric-specific QA pairs out of approximately 7,500 total entries.12 This fundamental imbalance suggests that the sheer volume of general medical data does not automatically translate to sufficient or appropriate pediatric data. This age-related data disparity necessitates dedicated pediatric data curation efforts to ensure that LLMs are equitable and effective for children.  
Another observation pertains to the differing utility of standardized growth data versus raw clinical data for LLMs. Highly standardized numerical data, such as the LMS parameters, percentiles, and z-scores provided by WHO and CDC growth charts, are ideal for quantitative analysis and tasks like regression (e.g., predicting growth trajectories) or classification (e.g., normal vs. abnormal growth).10 Conversely, EHRs like PEDSnet contain both structured measurements and rich, unstructured clinical notes.20 While unstructured notes offer invaluable contextual information, they present significant challenges for LLMs due to their inherent variability, incompleteness, and the need for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaningful information.40 The immediate utility for LLMs might be higher for structured data due to its clean format, but deeper clinical reasoning and comprehensive understanding necessitate the integration and sophisticated processing of unstructured text.  
A significant unmet need exists for truly multimodal pediatric growth datasets. The user query explicitly highlights the importance of multimodal data, including text, images, and genetic information. While specialized datasets exist for individual modalities, such as RSNA Bone Age for X-rays 7 and Kids First DRC for genomic and clinical data 35, there is not a single comprehensive dataset that seamlessly integrates all these diverse data types—anthropometrics, clinical notes, imaging, genetic information, and developmental milestones—specifically for general pediatric growth assessment. The development of multimodal LLMs, such as MedGemma, which is trained for medical text and image comprehension 42, underscores the potential of such integration. However, the current landscape indicates a fragmentation of pediatric data modalities. An ideal LLM for comprehensive pediatric growth assessment would require datasets that seamlessly integrate these diverse data types, which remains a substantial gap and a frontier for future data creation efforts.

## **3\. Suitability of Datasets for LLM Training and Evaluation**

Evaluating the suitability of identified datasets for LLM training and evaluation in pediatric growth assessment requires careful consideration of their data types, temporal characteristics, multimodal potential, and the availability of robust ground-truth labels.

### **3.1 Textual and Structured Data Compatibility**

Structured data, such as the numerical measurements found in the CDC and WHO Growth Charts 10 and the anthropometric data within PEDSnet 20 and the All of Us Research Program 23, are directly amenable to quantitative analysis. This type of data can be effectively used for regression tasks, such as predicting growth trajectories, or classification tasks, like categorizing growth as normal or abnormal. While LLMs are primarily text-centric, structured data can be processed by converting it into natural language descriptions or by using specialized embeddings that allow LLMs to interpret numerical values.  
Conversely, textual data, prevalent in EHR datasets like PEDSnet 20 and the All of Us program 23, consists of rich clinical notes, medical reports, and patient histories. This unstructured text is highly valuable for LLMs, enabling complex tasks such as clinical summarization, information extraction, and question answering.41 The ER-Reason benchmark, for example, specifically focuses on de-identified longitudinal clinical notes to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning.41 However, unstructured clinical text presents inherent challenges due to its variability, incompleteness, and the frequent use of complex medical terminology, abbreviations, and negated mentions (e.g., "no evidence of...").40  
Hybrid approaches that integrate both structured and unstructured data are crucial for comprehensive pediatric growth assessment. PEDSnet's data model, which includes both detailed anthropometric measurements and extensive clinical narratives, offers a holistic view of patient health.20 This integrated approach allows LLMs to leverage the precision of numerical data while gaining contextual understanding from textual information.

### **3.2 Longitudinal and Multimodal Data Considerations**

Longitudinal data is critically important for pediatric applications, as it enables the tracking of growth and development over time, the identification of subtle trends, and the prediction of future health outcomes.1 Datasets such as PEDSnet 17, the All of Us Research Program 23, and the NBSTRN Longitudinal Pediatric Data Resource (LPDR) 24 explicitly offer longitudinal patient data. The childdevdata R package also provides longitudinal developmental milestone assessments.32 However, a challenge with real-world longitudinal data is the presence of irregular follow-up schedules and missing values, which can pose statistical complexities.44  
Integrating diverse data types, known as multimodal data, can significantly enhance LLM performance by providing a more holistic patient view.43 Several datasets offer multimodal components relevant to pediatric growth:

* **Imaging \+ Structured Data:** The RSNA AI Pediatric Bone Age Challenge dataset combines X-ray images with structured bone age and sex labels.7 Similarly, the ARAN dataset provides full-body images alongside anthropometric measurements like height, weight, and head circumference.30  
* **Text \+ Imaging:** MedGemma is a multimodal LLM trained for medical text and image comprehension 42, indicating the utility of datasets that combine these modalities. Research on "Quantitative Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs in Pediatric Radiology Report Generation" further highlights the need for pediatric-specific multimodal data for tasks like radiology report generation.45  
* **Genomic \+ Clinical Data:** The Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC) integrates genomic sequencing data with clinical and phenotypic information, providing a foundation for understanding genetic influences on growth and development.35 The Facial phenotype-Gene-Disease Dataset (FGDD) links visual facial phenotypes with genes and diseases, demonstrating another form of multimodal integration.38  
* **Speech \+ Clinical Data:** The KidSpeak project utilizes speech data for developmental screening, showcasing the potential of auditory data as a modality in pediatric assessment.34

Despite these examples, a truly comprehensive multimodal dataset that seamlessly integrates all relevant pediatric growth assessment data types—anthropometrics, clinical notes, imaging, genetic information, and developmental milestones—is not readily apparent in the current landscape. This represents a significant area for future data creation.

### **3.3 Ground-Truth Labels for LLM Tasks**

The availability of high-quality ground-truth labels is essential for training and evaluating LLMs across various tasks in pediatric growth assessment:

* **Classification Tasks:** Datasets with clear diagnostic categories (e.g., normal vs. abnormal growth, faltering growth, obesity, developmental delay) are crucial. The WHO and CDC growth charts provide percentiles and z-scores that serve as de facto labels for growth status.2 PEDSnet includes standardized diagnoses 20, and the NBSTRN LPDR has Common Data Elements (CDEs) for specific genetic diseases.24 The RSNA Bone Age dataset provides precise bone age labels for classification of skeletal maturity.7  
* **Regression Tasks:** Datasets with continuous measurements are necessary for predicting growth trajectories or future values. Height, weight, BMI, and head circumference measurements available in PEDSnet 20, the All of Us Research Program 23, and ARAN 30 are suitable for such tasks. The childdevdata package provides raw milestone scores that can be aggregated into continuous developmental scores for regression analysis.32  
* **Natural Language Generation (NLG) Tasks:** Datasets containing clinical notes and reports, especially when paired with structured data or expert-written summaries, can be used for tasks like summarizing growth reports or generating clinical impressions. PEDSnet's extensive clinical notes 20 and ER-Reason's de-identified longitudinal clinical notes 41 are rich sources for NLG tasks, although they would benefit from specific expert annotation for pediatric growth summarization targets.  
* **Interpretability:** A key goal for LLMs in healthcare is to provide explainable and clinically validated outputs.2 Ground-truth labels should ideally support the evaluation of this aspect, potentially by including rationales or clinical interpretations alongside the primary labels. Logistic regression, for instance, is valued in clinical practice for its transparency and interpretability.46

### **3.4 Suitability Assessment of Datasets for LLM Applications (Table 3\)**

**Value of Table 3:** This table provides a critical evaluation of each dataset's practical utility for LLM development, moving beyond mere existence to assess *how* well it supports specific LLM tasks and data modalities. It directly addresses the "LLM-Relevant Features" step of the query by systematically comparing datasets across crucial dimensions, facilitating direct comparison and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses for LLM applications in pediatric growth assessment.

The "last mile" problem of unstructured clinical data for LLMs represents a significant hurdle. While EHRs like PEDSnet and All of Us contain vast amounts of clinical notes 20, these notes often exhibit characteristics such as "incompleteness, inaccuracy, and oversimplification," "variable language," "non-standard descriptions," "abbreviations," and "negated mentions".40 This means that merely having access to unstructured data is insufficient; sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, often beyond traditional rule-based systems, and extensive manual annotation are required to transform this raw text into a format truly useful for LLM training.40 The promise of LLMs leveraging clinical notes for pediatric growth assessment hinges on overcoming these data quality and processing challenges. This implies a need for substantial investment in data cleaning, standardization, and expert annotation, or the development of more robust, context-aware LLMs that can inherently handle noisy, real-world clinical text.  
The symbiotic relationship between LLMs and data modalities for comprehensive pediatric assessment is becoming increasingly apparent. The user query highlights the importance of multimodal data, encompassing text, images, and genetic information. While individual datasets often specialize in one or two modalities (e.g., RSNA for X-rays 7, Kids First DRC for genomics and clinical data 35, PEDSnet for structured EHR and clinical notes 20), no single comprehensive dataset currently offers a complete multimodal view specifically for general pediatric growth assessment. However, the inherent strength of LLMs lies in their ability to integrate and synthesize disparate information.43 The development of multimodal LLMs like MedGemma 42 is a step towards this integration. The future of LLMs in pediatric growth assessment will depend not just on their ability to process individual data types, but on their capacity to synthesize information from all relevant modalities (anthropometrics, clinical narratives, imaging, genetic markers, developmental scores). This necessitates the creation of new, integrated multimodal datasets or the development of sophisticated data fusion techniques to combine existing, siloed datasets, thereby pushing the boundaries of current LLM capabilities for a more holistic understanding of child health.

## **4\. Gaps, Challenges, and Limitations in Existing Datasets**

Despite the growing number of datasets relevant to pediatric healthcare, significant gaps, challenges, and limitations persist, particularly when considering their utility for training and evaluating LLMs for comprehensive pediatric growth assessment.

### **4.1 Data Scarcity and Diversity Issues**

A primary concern is the **limited demographic diversity** within existing datasets. Many resources lack comprehensive representation across geographic regions, socioeconomic strata, and ethnic groups.6 The pervasive "age bias" in medical benchmarks means that pediatric data is generally underrepresented compared to adult data, leading to models that may not generalize well to the unique physiological and developmental characteristics of children.13 While WHO growth standards aim for global applicability, they are explicitly noted as not being universally applicable to all countries and populations, highlighting the need for more diverse reference data.6  
Furthermore, while some datasets are large in overall patient count (e.g., PEDSnet with over 6.2 million children 17), **small sample sizes for specific conditions** remain a challenge. Rare growth disorders or uncommon developmental delays might still have limited data points within these broader datasets, hindering the robust training of LLMs for accurate recognition and prediction in these niche areas.  
The **lack of comprehensive longitudinal data across all modalities** is another significant gap. While EHRs like PEDSnet and All of Us offer valuable longitudinal clinical and anthropometric data 20, longitudinal imaging or genetic data specifically tied to growth trajectories across large, diverse pediatric cohorts is less common. For instance, the RSNA Bone Age dataset provides a large collection of X-ray images, but these are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal.7 This limits the ability of LLMs to learn complex, time-dependent patterns across all relevant data types.  
Finally, there is an **underrepresentation of specific age groups** within some datasets, or a lack of granular data for critical developmental windows. While WHO charts cover 0-5 years and CDC charts extend to 21 years, detailed longitudinal data with high-resolution measurements and associated clinical context for specific sensitive periods, such as infancy or the onset of puberty, may still be insufficient for fine-grained LLM training.

### **4.2 Data Quality, Privacy, and Ethical Concerns**

**Data quality issues** present substantial hurdles. Real-world EHR data is frequently characterized by **missing or noisy data**, necessitating extensive and often complex preprocessing steps.44 Automated methods have been developed to identify implausible values in pediatric EHR growth data, indicating that this is a recognized and ongoing challenge in data utilization.47 The irregular follow-up inherent in observational studies also contributes to patterns of missing data that must be statistically addressed.44  
Beyond structured data, the **incompleteness and variability in clinical notes** pose a significant "last mile" problem for LLMs. Unstructured clinical text can be incomplete, inaccurate, and oversimplified, often containing variable language, non-standard descriptions, abbreviations, and crucial negated mentions (e.g., "no signs of...").40 Traditional NLP techniques often struggle with these nuances, failing to interpret context or semantic meanings effectively.40 This means that even when large volumes of clinical notes are available, significant effort is required to make them truly usable for LLM training.  
**Data privacy concerns**, particularly regarding compliance with regulations like HIPAA in the U.S. and GDPR in Europe, are paramount due to the highly sensitive nature of pediatric health information. These regulations impose strict requirements on data handling, sharing, and anonymization, which directly impact dataset creation and LLM deployment.30 De-identification is a crucial step, as seen in datasets like ER-Reason 41 and those from the Pediatric Heart Network.48 The ARAN dataset explicitly highlights its ethics committee approval under GDPR guidelines for image data.30  
**Ethical considerations**, especially concerning informed consent for pediatric data, add another layer of complexity. Obtaining and managing informed consent from parents or primary caregivers for long-term research or data sharing involving minors is a multifaceted process.1 Furthermore, **potential biases in dataset representation** can lead to inequitable AI tools. If datasets disproportionately represent certain populations or fail to capture the diversity of real-world pediatric patients, LLMs trained on such data may perpetuate or even amplify existing health disparities.13

### **4.3 Addressing Privacy through Synthetic and Anonymized Data**

To overcome privacy barriers while maintaining data utility for LLM training, there is a growing imperative for the creation and utilization of synthetic or robustly anonymized datasets.30 Methods employed include manual anonymization, as demonstrated by the ARAN dataset where faces were masked on images 30, and advanced de-identification techniques for clinical notes, as applied in the ER-Reason benchmark.41 Synthetic data generation, leveraging advanced generative models, offers a promising avenue to create privacy-preserving datasets that mimic the statistical properties and complexity of real-world pediatric growth data without exposing sensitive patient information. This approach is crucial for enabling broader research and development in a privacy-compliant manner.

### **4.4 Identified Gaps and Challenges in Pediatric LLM Datasets (Table 4\)**

**Value of Table 4:** This table systematically summarizes the major limitations and obstacles in the current dataset landscape, providing a clear roadmap for future data collection and curation efforts. It directly addresses the "Gaps and Challenges" step of the query by offering a structured overview of the identified issues, making it easier to pinpoint areas for improvement and prioritize research directions in pediatric LLM development.  
**Table 4: Identified Gaps and Challenges in Pediatric LLM Datasets**

| Category | Specific Gap/Challenge | Impact on LLM Development/Evaluation | Relevant Snippets |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Data Scarcity & Diversity** | **Age Bias/Underrepresentation of Pediatric Data:** LLMs trained on adult-centric data perform suboptimally for children. | Leads to biased models, poor performance, and potentially harmful outputs for pediatric patients. | 13 |
|  | **Limited Demographic Diversity:** Lack of representation across geographic, socioeconomic, and ethnic groups. | Models may not generalize well to diverse pediatric populations, exacerbating health inequities. | 6 |

|  | **Potential Biases in Dataset Representation:** Reflects societal biases, leading to biased AI outputs. | Perpetuates health disparities if models are trained on unrepresentative data. | 13 |

The pervasive "age bias" in existing medical benchmarks creates a significant "cold start" problem for pediatric LLMs. The observation that LLMs generally lack foundational pediatric knowledge 13 means that simply adapting adult-trained LLMs for pediatric use is insufficient and potentially unsafe. This is because children have distinct physiological and developmental characteristics that differ fundamentally from adults.13 Therefore, models must either be retrained on substantial new pediatric data or extensively fine-tuned, both of which are resource-intensive and remain limited by the current scarcity of high-quality, pediatric-specific data. This situation points to a fundamental need for *pediatric-first* LLM development or highly specialized transfer learning strategies, driven by purpose-built pediatric datasets, rather than merely retrofitting models designed for adult populations.  
The interplay of data quality, privacy, and utility presents a complex challenge. Real-world pediatric EHRs offer rich, granular, and longitudinal data, as exemplified by PEDSnet.20 This granularity, while valuable for comprehensive analysis, makes de-identification challenging and increases the risk of re-identification, leading to stringent access controls.21 Conversely, highly anonymized or synthetic datasets, such as ARAN 30, are more privacy-preserving but may inadvertently lose critical nuances or realism necessary for robust LLM training in complex clinical scenarios. This tension implies that the challenge is not simply about collecting data, but about *how* to collect, curate, and share it in a way that maximizes its utility for LLM training while rigorously adhering to privacy and ethical standards. This calls for innovative data governance models, advanced anonymization techniques, and robust validation of synthetic datasets to ensure they accurately reflect the intricate nuances of pediatric growth and development without compromising patient confidentiality.

## **5\. LLM Applications in Pediatric Growth Assessment**

Large Language Models hold significant promise for transforming pediatric growth assessment by automating routine tasks, enhancing predictive capabilities, and improving communication within healthcare settings.

### **5.1 Automating Growth Chart Analysis and Risk Prediction**

LLMs can automate the generation of WHO or CDC growth percentiles and z-scores from raw anthropometric measurements.2 This capability can significantly streamline clinical workflows, reduce manual errors, and provide real-time assessment of a child's growth status. By processing these numerical inputs and comparing them against established growth standards, LLMs can rapidly flag deviations that warrant clinical attention.  
Furthermore, by analyzing longitudinal growth data, clinical notes, and potentially integrating genetic information, LLMs can predict risks of various growth-related disorders. This includes:

* **Failure to Thrive/Malnutrition:** Identifying subtle patterns in weight and height trajectories that indicate inadequate nutritional intake or underlying health issues.3  
* **Obesity:** Predicting the risk of future obesity based on early growth acceleration or persistent upward centile crossing in weight.6  
* **Endocrine Disorders:** Flagging subtle growth deviations or discrepancies in skeletal maturity that may indicate underlying hormonal imbalances or other endocrine conditions.7  
* **Developmental Delays:** Identifying early indicators from structured developmental milestone assessments or analyzing unstructured data like speech patterns for language delays.4

LLMs can integrate structured biometric data with unstructured clinical notes to identify patterns indicative of growth abnormalities, thereby improving diagnostic precision and timeliness.46 This integration allows for a more comprehensive assessment than relying on single data points or isolated measurements.

### **5.2 Enhancing Clinical Summarization and Communication**

LLMs possess the capability to process extensive clinical notes and growth records to generate concise, interpretable summaries for healthcare providers.41 These summaries can highlight key growth trends, significant deviations from expected patterns, and relevant clinical context, thereby saving clinicians valuable time and improving information transfer during patient handovers or consultations.  
Moreover, LLMs can significantly assist in patient-provider communication. They can be utilized to explain complex growth metrics, such as percentiles, z-scores, or bone age assessments, to parents and caregivers in an understandable and empathetic manner.2 This could involve generating tailored explanations that address specific parental concerns or providing clear answers to common questions about their child's growth patterns, fostering better understanding and engagement in their child's care.

### **5.3 Ensuring Explainability and Clinical Validation**

In the high-stakes environment of healthcare, LLM outputs must be explainable and transparent.46 Clinicians need to understand *why* an LLM made a particular prediction, flagged a risk, or generated a specific summary to trust and confidently act upon its recommendations. The emphasis on interpretability is underscored by the value placed on models like logistic regression in clinical practice, which are praised for their transparency and reproducibility.46  
Any LLM application in pediatric growth assessment requires rigorous clinical validation to ensure its accuracy, safety, and effectiveness in real-world clinical settings. This process involves comparing LLM outputs against expert clinical judgment and actual patient outcomes.46 Without demonstrable explainability and thorough clinical validation, LLMs will face significant barriers to widespread adoption in healthcare environments, where patient safety and trust are paramount.  
The application of LLMs in pediatric growth assessment suggests a significant shift from merely interpreting existing data to enabling more predictive and proactive care. Traditional growth assessment primarily focuses on interpreting current or past growth patterns against established standards.2 However, LLMs, through their ability to analyze vast amounts of longitudinal data and identify complex, subtle patterns, can move beyond this reactive approach to *predict* future risks, such as the onset of obesity or the development of endocrine disorders.6 This capability allows for a transformation of the assessment process from reactive diagnosis to proactive risk stratification. LLMs thus have the potential to enable a paradigm shift in pediatric care, allowing for earlier, more targeted interventions based on individualized risk profiles predicted from comprehensive growth and developmental data.  
Furthermore, the deployment of LLMs in this domain presents a dual challenge: ensuring clinical utility for healthcare providers while simultaneously focusing on human-centered design for patient and family communication. LLMs must be clinically validated and provide explainable outputs for clinicians to integrate them effectively into their workflows.2 At the same time, they must facilitate patient-provider communication 6 and be capable of explaining complex medical information to parents in an understandable way.2 This necessitates LLMs that are not only technically accurate but also designed with a deep understanding of clinical workflows and effective communication strategies for diverse audiences. The success of LLMs in pediatric growth assessment will therefore depend not just on their advanced AI capabilities, but on their ability to seamlessly integrate into human-centric healthcare processes, enhancing both clinical decision-making and family engagement. This requires a strong emphasis on user experience and communication design throughout the LLM development lifecycle.

## **6\. Recommendations for Ideal LLM Benchmark Datasets and Evaluation**

To effectively guide the development and evaluation of LLMs for pediatric growth assessment, a strategic approach to dataset creation and evaluation is essential.

### **6.1 Criteria for Optimal Datasets**

An ideal LLM benchmark dataset for pediatric growth assessment should adhere to the following criteria:

* **Size and Scope:** Datasets should be sufficiently large to capture the variability of normal growth, rare conditions, and diverse growth patterns, ideally encompassing millions of patient records, similar to PEDSnet's scale of over 6.2 million children.17  
* **Diversity:** To ensure generalizability and mitigate bias, datasets must include broad demographic representation, encompassing geographic, socioeconomic, and ethnic diversity.6 This is critical to address the inherent age bias in current medical benchmarks.13  
* **Comprehensive Data Types:** Optimal datasets should integrate multiple data modalities:  
  * **Structured Anthropometrics:** Precise measurements of height, weight, BMI, and head circumference, accompanied by accurate timestamps.1  
  * **Unstructured Clinical Notes:** Rich narratives from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), such as those found in PEDSnet 20, which provide essential contextual understanding for LLMs, despite the processing challenges these present.  
  * **Imaging Data:** X-rays (e.g., for bone age assessment 7) and 3D scans (e.g., from datasets like ARAN 30) for visual assessment of physical development.  
  * **Genetic/Genomic Data:** For identifying underlying genetic predispositions to growth disorders or developmental delays, drawing from resources like the Kids First Data Resource Center.35  
  * **Developmental Milestone Data:** Standardized assessments of motor, cognitive, language, social, and adaptive skills, as provided by resources like the childdevdata R package.32  
* **Longitudinality:** This is a fundamental requirement for pediatric applications. Datasets must contain longitudinal records to track growth trajectories and developmental progress over time, enabling robust predictive modeling.1 Ideally, data should span from birth through adolescence to capture critical developmental windows.  
* **High-Quality Annotation:** Expert-validated ground-truth labels are paramount for effective LLM training and evaluation. This includes precise growth percentiles, z-scores, clear diagnostic categories, and potentially clinician-annotated summaries or interpretations of growth patterns.  
* **Interoperability:** Data should adhere to common data models (e.g., OMOP CDM, PEDSnet CDM 16) and standardized vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, HPO, MONDO 20) to facilitate seamless data integration and sharing across different healthcare institutions and research initiatives.

### **6.2 Strategies for Dataset Creation and Augmentation**

Given the identified gaps, proactive strategies are needed to create and augment pediatric growth assessment datasets:

* **Collaboration with Pediatric Hospitals and Networks:** Partnering with large pediatric healthcare systems and research networks, such as the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia for PEDSnet 17, is crucial for accessing real-world, longitudinal EHR data and fostering a learning health system.  
* **Integrating Wearable Device Data:** Wearable devices can provide high-frequency, continuous physiological data that could significantly augment traditional, episodic growth measurements. This would require careful consideration of data quality, privacy, and standardization protocols.  
* **Generating Synthetic Data:** Utilizing advanced generative models (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or diffusion models) to create synthetic, privacy-preserving datasets that accurately mimic the statistical properties and complexity of real pediatric growth data. This approach offers a promising solution to address privacy concerns while expanding data availability.30  
* **Federated Learning:** Implementing decentralized training approaches where LLMs are trained on local datasets across multiple institutions without centralizing raw, sensitive data. This method inherently addresses privacy concerns while leveraging diverse data sources.  
* **Crowdsourcing and Expert Annotation:** For specific tasks, such as clinical note summarization, identifying nuanced growth patterns, or labeling developmental milestones, leveraging the expertise of pediatric clinicians for annotation can significantly enrich existing datasets and improve ground-truth quality.

### **6.3 Recommended LLM Evaluation Metrics**

Evaluating LLMs in pediatric growth assessment requires a comprehensive set of metrics tailored to the specific tasks:

* **For Classification Tasks** (e.g., normal vs. abnormal growth, disorder prediction):  
  * **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of predictions.46  
  * **Sensitivity (Recall):** Quantifies the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases (e.g., actual growth disorders).46  
  * **Specificity:** Measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative cases (e.g., normal growth).  
  * **Precision:** Represents the proportion of positive predictions that are truly positive.  
  * **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly useful for datasets where class imbalance is present.  
  * **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC):** Measures the overall discriminative power of the model across various classification thresholds.46  
  * **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR):** Especially valuable for highly imbalanced datasets where the positive class (e.g., a rare disorder) is infrequent.  
* **For Regression Tasks** (e.g., predicting growth trajectories, future height):  
  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.7  
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the magnitude of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors.  
  * **R-squared (R²):** Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.  
* **For Natural Language Generation Tasks** (e.g., summarizing reports, patient communication):  
  * **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) / ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Gisting Evaluation) scores:** These metrics quantify the overlap between the generated text and human-written reference texts.  
  * **Clinical Utility and Fidelity Metrics:** Human evaluation by expert clinicians is essential to assess the factual correctness, clinical relevance, interpretability, and safety of generated outputs.  
  * **Readability Scores:** For patient-facing outputs, metrics such as the Flesch-Kincaid grade level should be used to ensure clarity and comprehensibility for non-medical audiences.  
* **Explainability Metrics:** Beyond traditional performance, the transparency and interpretability of LLM outputs should be evaluated. This could involve assessing saliency maps for multimodal models or the fidelity of generated explanations to underlying clinical evidence.

The imperative of a "pediatric-first" data strategy is clear. Given the inherent age bias in existing medical LLM benchmarks 13 and the unique developmental characteristics of children 1, simply scaling up existing adult datasets or retrofitting adult-trained LLMs is insufficient. The recommendations emphasize the need for pediatric-specific collaborations with healthcare networks 17, the integration of data types uniquely relevant to children (e.g., bone age X-rays, developmental milestones, facial phenotypes) 7, and comprehensive longitudinal tracking from birth through adolescence.6 This approach recognizes that children are not merely small adults, but a distinct population with unique medical needs and data characteristics. A successful LLM ecosystem for pediatric growth assessment requires a fundamental shift towards a "pediatric-first" data strategy, prioritizing the unique needs and characteristics of children throughout the data lifecycle, from collection and annotation to model development and evaluation.  
The critical role of clinical expertise in data curation and LLM evaluation cannot be overstated. While LLMs offer powerful analytical capabilities, their outputs must be "explainable and clinically validated" to be trustworthy in healthcare settings.46 The process of identifying implausible values in EHR growth data relies on the "judgment of physician reviewers".47 Similarly, datasets like the RSNA Bone Age Challenge were "annotated by multiple expert observers" and "two pediatric radiologists".7 This highlights that raw data alone is insufficient; clinical expertise is indispensable for high-quality annotation, establishing accurate ground-truth labels, and performing the ultimate validation of LLM performance in a clinical context. The development of effective and trustworthy LLMs for pediatric growth assessment is therefore an inherently interdisciplinary endeavor, requiring deep collaboration between AI researchers, data scientists, and pediatric clinicians at every stage, from dataset design to model deployment and continuous monitoring.

## **7\. Sources and Validation**

The comprehensive nature of this report necessitated a rigorous and multi-faceted search strategy to identify relevant datasets and supporting research.

### **7.1 Literature and Database Search Strategy**

The investigation involved a deep search across various academic and medical information sources:

* **Academic Literature:** Primary academic databases such as PubMed 47, Google Scholar, and arXiv 34 were extensively searched. Keywords used included "Large Language Model," "LLM," "pediatric growth," "benchmark datasets," "EHR," "clinical notes," "imaging," "genetic data," and "developmental milestones."  
* **Medical Databases and Repositories:** Specialized medical data repositories were explored, including PhysioNet 25 for clinical and physiological data, and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) 31 for pediatric imaging datasets.  
* **Open-Access Data Platforms:** Platforms such as Hugging Face Datasets 11 and data.gov 10 were consulted for publicly available datasets. GitHub repositories, particularly for open-source data and code like the childdevdata R package 32, were also reviewed.  
* **Health Informatics Organizations and Networks:** Resources from organizations like Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) 18 and PEDSnet 16 provided valuable insights into common data models and large-scale pediatric EHR data.  
* **Specific Dataset Initiatives:** Focused searches were conducted on initiatives such as the Kids First Data Resource Center 35 and the RSNA AI Challenges 7 to identify specialized pediatric data resources.

### **7.2 Cross-Referencing with Clinical Guidelines**

To ensure the relevance and clinical applicability of the findings, information was cross-referenced with established clinical guidelines and standards:

* **WHO Growth Standards and CDC Growth Charts:** These are directly referenced as the primary and most widely accepted standards for pediatric growth assessment.2 The report ensures that identified datasets and proposed LLM applications align with the principles and methodologies embedded within these foundational clinical tools.  
* **Pediatric Care Standards:** The overall context of "pediatric health care provider" 1 and the objective of "optimizing health in both individuals and populations" 6 implicitly guided the adherence to best practices in pediatric care. The recommendations within this report are framed to support and enhance clinical decision-making in pediatrics, consistent with broad professional guidelines.

### **7.3 Summarize Key Findings and Citing Sources**

All findings presented in this report are structured logically through the use of headings, subheadings, and tables. Every major claim and data point is supported by direct citations to the provided research snippets, following the format \[snippet\_id, snippet\_id\]. This transparent citation practice ensures traceability and allows readers to verify the information presented. URLs and DOIs for the cited sources are implicitly linked through the snippet IDs and would be fully detailed in a comprehensive bibliography of a final published report.  
A notable observation from the data is the disconnect between data availability and established clinical gold standards. While WHO and CDC growth charts are widely recognized as the primary, harmonized, and essential standards for pediatric growth assessment 2, the underlying raw data used to *create* these standards is not always readily available in a format directly usable for LLM training or benchmarking. Instead, current datasets often contain measurements from which these standards can be derived (e.g., PEDSnet's anthropometric data 20), or tools like PediTools that *apply* the standards to input data.56 This situation indicates a gap between the clinical "gold standard" of growth charts and readily available LLM-ready datasets that explicitly reflect the granular, underlying data used to establish these norms. Future data initiatives should consider releasing the underlying raw, longitudinal data used to establish or validate clinical guidelines (like growth charts) in an LLM-friendly format, complete with expert annotations reflecting clinical interpretations. This would help bridge this gap and significantly accelerate LLM development by providing models with direct access to the foundational data that informs clinical practice.

## **8\. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations**

The development and deployment of LLMs in pediatric healthcare, particularly for sensitive applications like growth assessment, are subject to stringent ethical and regulatory considerations. These factors profoundly impact dataset creation, data sharing, and the ultimate clinical utility of AI tools.

### **8.1 Data Privacy, Informed Consent, and Bias Mitigation**

**Data privacy** is of paramount concern in pediatric healthcare due to the vulnerability of the patient population. Strict measures for de-identification are essential to protect patient privacy in datasets used for LLM training.21 The ARAN dataset, for instance, explicitly mentions its ethics committee approval under European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines for image data, highlighting the necessity of robust privacy protocols.30  
**Informed consent** for pediatric data collection and sharing for research purposes is a complex ethical and legal requirement. Obtaining and managing consent from parents or legal guardians, and where appropriate, assent from older children, is crucial for any study involving minors.1 For longitudinal studies that track children over many years, managing ongoing consent and adapting to changes in legal guardianship or a child's capacity for assent adds further complexity.  
**Potential biases in dataset representation** pose a significant ethical challenge. Datasets can inadvertently reflect existing societal biases, leading to the underrepresentation of certain populations, such as specific ethnic groups, socioeconomic strata, or even particular age groups within the broader pediatric spectrum.6 The "age bias" identified in many medical benchmarks, where pediatric data is scarce, is a direct example of this.13 Such biases can result in LLMs that perform poorly or inequitably for these underserved groups, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities. Mitigation strategies include active efforts to ensure diverse and representative sampling in dataset creation 13, along with regular auditing of datasets for inherent biases and fairness metrics. Robust de-identification, anonymization, and the generation of synthetic data 30 are also crucial for balancing privacy with the need for data utility.

### **8.2 Regulatory Landscape for AI in Pediatric Healthcare**

The regulatory landscape significantly impacts the creation of pediatric datasets and the deployment of LLMs in clinical settings.

* **FDA Guidelines (U.S.):** In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates medical devices, including Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). LLMs intended for clinical use, such as those assisting in diagnosis, risk prediction, or treatment recommendations for pediatric growth assessment, would likely fall under FDA oversight. This necessitates rigorous validation, pre-market review, and potentially post-market surveillance processes to ensure safety and effectiveness.  
* **GDPR (Europe):** The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe imposes stringent rules on the processing of personal data, with particular emphasis on sensitive health data and data concerning children. This regulation profoundly impacts how pediatric datasets are collected, stored, shared, and used for LLM training and deployment, requiring explicit consent, data minimization, and robust security measures.30  
* **HIPAA (U.S.):** The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S. establishes national standards for protecting sensitive patient health information. Compliance with HIPAA is mandatory for any healthcare organization or researcher handling Protected Health Information (PHI), directly affecting how pediatric data is managed and shared for LLM development.

These regulatory requirements significantly influence dataset design (e.g., necessitating robust de-identification protocols), data access (e.g., restricted access to sensitive data requiring specific approvals), and the validation and deployment pathways for LLMs in clinical settings. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or ethics committees play a critical role in reviewing and approving studies involving human data, ensuring ethical conduct and patient protection.7  
The trade-off between data granularity/realism and privacy/compliance is a fundamental tension in pediatric AI. Real-world pediatric EHRs offer rich, granular, longitudinal data, as demonstrated by PEDSnet's extensive database.20 However, this level of granularity makes de-identification challenging and increases the risk of re-identification, leading to strict access controls and data use agreements.21 Conversely, highly anonymized or synthetic datasets, while more privacy-preserving 30, might inadvertently lose critical nuances or the realism necessary for robust LLM training in complex clinical scenarios. Navigating this trade-off effectively requires innovative solutions, such as federated learning, where models are trained on decentralized data without raw data leaving its source, or the development of privacy-preserving AI techniques like differential privacy. These approaches are crucial to maximize data utility for LLM development without compromising the imperative of protecting vulnerable pediatric patient privacy.  
The evolving regulatory landscape is increasingly acting as a driver for responsible AI innovation. While regulatory hurdles (such as those imposed by FDA, GDPR, and HIPAA) might initially appear restrictive, they are essential for ensuring patient safety, maintaining public trust in AI in healthcare, and fostering responsible development. The existence of ethics-approved datasets like ARAN, which comply with stringent regulations like GDPR 30, demonstrates that adherence to these frameworks is achievable. Furthermore, the push for explainable AI 46 is partly driven by these regulatory and ethical demands for transparency and accountability in AI decision-making. This suggests that the regulatory environment, rather than being a static barrier, actively shapes the requirements for responsible AI development in pediatrics. LLM developers must proactively engage with regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines from the outset of dataset design and model development, fostering "AI by design" principles that prioritize safety, fairness, and transparency alongside technological advancement.

## **Conclusion**

The comprehensive investigation into Large Language Model (LLM) benchmark datasets for pediatric growth assessment reveals a critical need for specialized, diverse, longitudinal, and multimodal data resources. Current general medical LLM benchmarks are largely insufficient due to a pervasive age bias, which leads to the underrepresentation of pediatric-specific data nuances and potentially suboptimal or inequitable performance in child healthcare applications.  
To advance the utility of LLMs in this sensitive domain, a concerted effort is required. This includes fostering collaborative initiatives between AI researchers, pediatric clinicians, and data scientists to curate and develop new datasets that capture the unique physiological and developmental characteristics of children across all age groups. Such datasets must integrate structured anthropometric measurements, rich unstructured clinical notes, diverse imaging data (e.g., X-rays, 3D scans), comprehensive genetic information, and standardized developmental milestone assessments. Crucially, these datasets must be longitudinal, enabling LLMs to track growth trajectories and developmental progress over time, moving beyond static snapshots to facilitate predictive and proactive care.  
Furthermore, adherence to stringent ethical and regulatory guidelines is paramount throughout the entire data lifecycle and LLM development process. This encompasses robust data privacy measures, meticulous informed consent protocols, and proactive strategies to mitigate biases in dataset representation. The regulatory landscape, including guidelines from bodies like the FDA and regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, should be viewed not as a barrier but as a framework that drives responsible AI innovation, ensuring patient safety, transparency, and trust.  
Investing in robust pediatric-specific datasets and tailored evaluation frameworks is essential to unlock the transformative potential of LLMs in improving child health outcomes and ensuring equitable, high-quality pediatric care. The future success of AI in this field hinges on a pediatric-first data strategy that prioritizes the unique needs of children and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration to build trustworthy and impactful AI solutions.
